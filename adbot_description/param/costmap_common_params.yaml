#The "obstacle_range" parameter determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap
#The "raytrace_range" parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading. Setting it to 3.0 meters
#as we have above means that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to 3.0 meters away given a sensor reading.

footprint: [[0.015, 0.125], [-0.28, 0.125], [-0.28, -0.125], [0.015, -0.125]]

#Here we set either the footprint of the robot or the radius of the robot if it is circular. 
#Center of the robot is assumed to be at (0.0, 0.0)

inflation_radius: 2.0 #inflation radius controls how far away the zero cost point is from the obstacle
cost_scaling_factor: 2.5 #Setting it higher will make the decay curve more steep.
